Chrissie, a young, ambitious VP from the US headquarters, is tasked with turning around a failing business in an English seaside backwater.

Beth is a dreamer. A software engineer who envisions a better world for her customers, her colleagues and loved ones.
Fearless, she is also frustrated by the inefficiencies and waste she witnesses at work. She is tired of being on call and tired
of caring for her family and her burnt-out husband.

When things go badly wrong at work, both are confronted with the fact that they might unwittingly be party to a murder.

When money is more important than lives, how can regular folk make a living without feeling like they are selling themselves, their
colleagues, the environment or their families out?

A modern local hero stands up to protect what is truly important.
