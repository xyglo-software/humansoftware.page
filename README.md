Beth is a dreamer, envisioning a better world for her loved ones. As a fearless engineer, she is frustrated by the inefficiencies and waste
she witnesses. She is simultaneously tired of being on call for her job and having to care for her family and her burnt-out husband.

But when things go wrong at work, Beth is confronted with the fact that she might unwittingly be party to a murder.

When money is more important than lives, how can regular working folk make a living without feeling like they are selling themselves, the environment or their families out?
